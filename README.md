# Project 1

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

## Todo:

Backend
- book search
- add reviews
- calculate ratings

Frontend
- search page
- book detail page
    - reviews for books
- use js to ensure more careful deletion (like typing in username to confirm)

Done:
- login
- logout
- user registration
- change password
- redirect back to prev page on:
    - login
    - register
    - logout
- delete account
    - should reviews be deleted? No


Be careful about (Which I spent hours debugging):
- Commit! Commit! Commit! Commit everytime modifying database (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)

Problems that still exist:

Styling:
- How to get the search icon to be inside box?
- Underline link on hover doesn't work for header links
