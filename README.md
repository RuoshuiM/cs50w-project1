# Project 1

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

## Todo-list:

### Backend
- book search
- add reviews
- calculate ratings

### Frontend
- search page
    - use bootstrap cards for each result book
- book detail page
    - reviews for books
- use bootstrap for nicer form validation messages
- use js to ensure more careful deletion (like typing in username to confirm)

### Done:
- login
- logout
- user registration
- change password
- redirect back to prev page on:
    - login
    - register
    - logout
- delete account
    - should reviews be deleted? No


### Be careful about (Which I spent hours debugging):
- Commit! Commit! Commit! Commit everytime modifying database (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
- Update Bootstrap! (So dropdown-menu-right and custom_forms work!)

### Problems that still exist:

- Styling:
    - How to get the search icon to be inside of the search box?
    - Underline link on hover doesn't work for header links
