# Project 1

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

## Todo:

Backend
- delete account
    - should reviews be deleted?
- book search
- add reviews
- calculate ratings

Frontend
- delete account
    - use js for modal
- search page
- book detail page
    - reviews for books

Done:
- login
- logout
- user registration
- change password
- redirect back to prev page on:
    - login
    - register
    - logout


Be careful about (Which I spent hours debugging):
- Commit! Commit! Commit! Commit everytime modifying database (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
